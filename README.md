  a very simple case study of implementing **modular** and **reusable**  **Sass**.
  the project which is a one page application focuses on writing **clean production code** using the following principles.

  
  1.**Semantic HTML5  Elements princeples**

     ```<header>``` defines a header for the document or a section

    ```<footer>``` defines a footer for the document or a section

    ```<nav>``` defines navigation links in the document

    ```<main>``` defines the main content of a document

    ```<section>``` defines a section in the document—the spec defines this as “a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading," so you can think of it as being like a chapter

    ```<article>``` defines an article in the document

    ```<aside>``` defines content aside from the page content

    ```<address>``` defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article

    ```<figure>``` defines self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code blocks, etc.
